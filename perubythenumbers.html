					<h3>The final project of the semester involved designing a comprehensive infographic of a randomly selected country over the course of four weeks; in my case, the country was Peru. The infographic had to uphold certain criteria, such as portraying the nation's geographical location relative to its neighbors, comparing its physical size to that of another territory, state, or country, detailing a brief history, as well as agricultural and economic summary, among others. Simultaneously, the elements of the infographic, such as the iconography, had to remain consistent and fit within a reasonable paper size.<br><br> 
					This infographic is typeset in Din Pro, due to its readability, and measures 36 by 20.65 inches. Statistics are taken from the CIA Factbook. All icons and other illustrations are done by myself. </h3>

					<h3><b>Identifying Peru</b><br><br>
						To differentiate Peru's data from that of other countries, I initially decided to mark each instance of Peru's identity in red while everyone else would be black, or some other neutral color.<br><br>
						I began to create the infographic by drawing a series of maps highlighting Peru's main geographic features and cities, as well as its location in relation to the South American continent and size relative to a well known state, country, or coast. After doing a bit of research, I decided to highlight Lima, Peru's capital, along with a few other cities placed throughout the country and major geographic features. Peru also happens to be 3/4 the size of Alaska, which I underlaid at scale.</h3>

					<h3><b>Formulating a Layout</b><br><br>
						The arrangement of the infographic changed quite a bit during the sketching phase. I found out which graphics to use for each bit of information (for example, population will be represented by a pictograph, while ethnicity percentages will be shown via donut graph) and estimated the amount of space each graphic would take on the page. As because the infographic should remain a reasonable size, I limited myself with 24 by 36 inches to work with. ​​​​​​​</h3>

					<h3><b>Graphics</b><br><br>
						For the sake of clarity, I chose to stick to traditional methods of information design by using simple graphics. The infographic makes use of donut, bar, and time graphs, as well as pictographs, Sankey diagrams, and use of scale.</h3>
