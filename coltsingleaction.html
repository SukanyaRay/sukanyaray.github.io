					<h5>Since its patent in 1872, the Colt Single Action Army pistol has remained an American icon. Issued as a standard military model until 1892, it gained traction in amongst the civilian population, where it was used by sportsmen and thieves alike. Its reputation grew further after its introduction in western films, gracing the hips of actors such as John Wayne Clint Eastwood.<br><br> 
					This infographic is to celebrate the Colt's simplicity despite its thriving popularity. There are two versions of the design: one in black and white, the other in color; both are inspired by Lego and IKEA assembly instructions.<br><br>After taking a peek at these graphics, you should have a very basic understanding of the Colt's parts.</h5>

					<h5><b>The Black and White Version</b><br><br>
						This is the first version of the pistol that was made. The goal was to create an infographic that provided a clear view of the gun's parts, as well as steps showing how to put it together.<br><br>
						Here, the gun is in an 'exploded' format, so all the parts can be seen at an angle. The numbers next to each part correlate to the part's heirarchy when being put together.</h5>

					<h5>Of course, there was an obvious problem-- the diagram looked more complex than it needed to be. Admittedly enough, I think the all black looks pretty neat, but for someone unfamiliar with guns, or even revolvers, for that matter, the illustration doesn't really explain anything.<br><br></h5>

					<h5><b>The Color Version</b><br><br>
					This brought about the color version, which can be seen here. The pistol is now made up of parts that are one of four colors, each chosen because they're colors most of us easily recognize.<br><br>The blue encompasses the basic body and barrel of the pistol.<br><br>The green is made up of the trigger system.<br><br>The black is the outer grip.<br><br>And the red encompasses the revolver mechanism itself.
						This way, it is easier for someone to digest the visual rather than see scattered parts and numbers. Any of the color groups can be assembled before the other, and when put together in the end, make up the pistol.</h5>
